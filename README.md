# landing-page

This webpage is an example landing page for a fake company. 

The layout of the webpage is built using flexbox.

The purpose of the project is to solidify my HTML and CSS
knowledge so far and to become more comfortable with flexbox.

A live preview of the website can be accessed at: https://hnnhcmmngs.github.io/landing-page/
